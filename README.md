# Winning

This app was created for entertainment purposes only.

While winning lottery numbers are completely random, and therefore, impossible to predict, some numbers seem to come up more - they become “hot.”  For whatever reason, they become more likely to be chosen.  Some of the numbers of this week’s drawings were likely chosen within the last few weeks, and those numbers will turn up again in the next few weeks.  And most numbers will remain “cool” - most numbers of this week’s drawing are more likely to have not been chosen over the last few weeks, and also will not be chosen for the next few.

Because it’s impossible to predict which of the hot numbers, if any, will be picked, and which of the cool numbers, will be picked, the lottery is very difficult to predict.

But, by sorting for numbers that are hot - favoring those numbers - a player can increase his likelihood of hitting some of the numbers - sometimes, of hitting a significant number, and that makes winning a prize more likely, and the more numbers are hit, the closer a player is to a jackpot.

The Winning! algorithm pulls hot numbers and cool ones, but in a random combination, for a pick that is more likely to win.

Features to come will be: 
1) Players will be able to set their default lottery.
2) The ability to set a player's location, so that only relevant lotteries will be shown. 
3) The display will show which numbers are hot and which numbers are cool.
