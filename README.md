# Winning

a program that pulls winning roadrunner and powerball from the last (approximately) 30 numbers to its database, and which
sorts them, and gives back picks that are random, but weighted - hotter numbers are more likely to be picked.  

ultimately would prefer to be able to use this for more lotteries.

also, might like to add features of showing which numbers are hot and which numbers are not - possibly sort for patterns, as well - how many times each number in a set of winning numbers has been picked in the previous 30 days.
